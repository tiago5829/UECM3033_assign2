## Task 1 --  $LU$ Factorization or SOR method

The reports, codes and supporting documents are to be uploaded to Github at:

Explain your selection criteria here.

The condition is set to be np.count_nonzero(A) > 1/2*len(A). If the none zero elements in matrix A is greater than half of the length of matrix A, it will perform LU factorization, else it will perform SOR method. 

Explain how you implement your `task1.py` here.

## Task 2 -- SVD method and image compression

Put here your picture file (Lenna.png)

How many non zero element in $\Sigma$?

Put here your lower and better resolution pictures. Explain how you generate
these pictures from `task2.py`.

What is a sparse matrix?
